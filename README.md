# DSC_CleaningDataProject

This repository is the project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course for the John Hopkins University Data Science track   

The aim of the project is to demonstrate the learner’s ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.   

## Structure of the repository   
- [data](data) -  This contains the HAR data   
- [data/UCI HAR Dataset](data/UCI HAR Dataset) -  Contains the extracted HAR dataset   
-	[scripts/run_analysis.r](scripts/run_analysis.r) – This is the R code showing the process taken to tidy up the data   
-	[outputs/tidy_meanandstd.txt](outputs/tidy_meanandstd.txt) – This is the tidied up data set containing only the mean and standard deviation value. First line is the list of headers   
-	[outputs/tidy_summary.txt](outputs/tidy_summary.txt) – This is the a dataset containing a mean of all the variables in outputs/tidy_meanandstd.txt for each activity and each subject    
-	[CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) – This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
